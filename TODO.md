Bugs to Fix
-----------
- Script cannot accept paths that are space-escaped.<br>
  For example, `./Backup2Mount /mnt/drive /home/user/folder\ with\ spaces/`

- Script should be able to run without root privileges.

- Options should be able to come after _as well as_ before the non-option arguments.<br>
  Such as, `./Backup2Mount -q /mnt/drive /home/user/folder -b`

Features to Add
---------------
none so far!
